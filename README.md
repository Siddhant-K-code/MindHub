Problem Statement

 Fake news websites deliberately publish hoaxes and disinformation to drive web traffic inflamed by social media. These sites are distinguished from news satire (which is humorous) as they mislead and sometimes profit from readers' gullibility. While most fake news sites are portrayed to be spin offs of other news sites.

 

Our Thoughts

·         A lot of false news flow around us.

·         No machine below supercomputer can differentiate between the two.

·         So, Why not let humans make the decision…….?

·         Here is our solution...

 

Our Application

·         We tried to make an Application that can take news from different websites and let people decide if it is true or relevent.

·         We plan to modify the application into a learning application that can more innovatively decide the significance of individuals depending on their proximity to the incident.

·         There is a plan to evolve the application into a game that returns credit for active and honest participation.

·         Based on what people says the news becomes 

  ··  of the people

  ··   for the people

  ··   by the people
